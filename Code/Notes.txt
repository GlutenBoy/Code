One button to code (in the form of a keyboard).
To start when you click the button you create 1 line of code (Loc).

With ï»¿LoC you can MAKE software which you can SELL to make money.

Different software are worth different amount or money based on the type (batch file to all platform game) and by % of LoC with bug.
The % of bug reduces the amount by that %. Example a software worth 100$ with 20% of bugs will sell for 80$.

With money you can buy different type of things:
* Tools to augment the number of LoC when coding (click the button)
* Tools to reduce % of bugs produced.
* 

Idea:
Should we decide to make a software before we start coding? Example: we choose to make a Windows Program. Once we code or programmer code
all LoC goes toward this goal until complete? Maybe we can make 2 things at the same time, have a keyboard button for each and/or assign
a programmer to it.
