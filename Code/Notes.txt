One button to code (in the form of a keyboard).
To start when you click the button you create 1 line of code (Loc).

With LoC you can MAKE software which you can SELL to make money.

Different software are worth different amount or money based on the type (batch file to all platform game) and by % of LoC with bug.
The % of bug reduces the amount by that %. Example a software worth 100$ with 20% of bugs will sell for 80$.

With money you can buy different type of things:
* Tools to augment the number of LoC when coding (click the button)
* Tools to reduce % of bugs produced.

You can also hire people:
* Hire programmer, these produces x amount of LoC per seconds
* Hire tester, these reduce % of LoC produced with Bugs
* Hire saleperson, these sales your software automatically once done
* Hire Marketing expert, these increase original value of software (after of before bug?)
People as a salary of x$ per seconds (important to make them work!) 
You can hire more than one type of person.

Idea:
Should we decide to make a software before we start coding? Example: we choose to make a Windows Program. Once we code or programmer code
all LoC goes toward this goal until complete? Maybe we can make 2 things at the same time, have a keyboard button for each and/or assign
a programmer to it.
Should we introduce the concept of months? Salary could be base on the month, paid at beginning of months?, if not you lose the hire?
Disgruntly employee leave with a chunch of LoC? A month could be x amount of seconds.
